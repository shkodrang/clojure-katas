  "p: total number of chips,
   m: total number of blue chips,
   n: number of consecutive draws
   output: the probability of n consecutive draws of blue chips out of a bucket that has p chips,
   m out of p chips are blue

   example:
   If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of 15 blue discs and 6 red discs,
   and 2 discs were taken at random, it can be seen that the probability of taking 2 blue discs, P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2."
